"there are so few sequels that do work , and have something a bit more to say from the original .","plus it 's cool that there are more nods to stoker and the original vampire mythology ( the reference to wild roses , for instance ) , and the new vampire 's sidekickers are equally as weird as jonathan stark 's billy cole in the original ."

the kung - fu sequences were deftly shot .,"maybe not the best keanu reeves but name me an actor who has box - office appeal but could portray the uneasy and vulnerable protagonist , neo , to a t the way reeves did . but , come to think of it , if you pit any actor beside laurence fishburne , you 're bound to confuse that actor for bad acting ."
a fun movie with no worries and some feel good moments .,"it has some good scenes and lines that almost reach pixar - level of quality , but most of it was just very goofy kids movie fodder ."
i think you will appreciate this film .,"if you 're a scorsese fan , which i am , i think you will appreciate this film . you can clearly see the scorsese touch ranging from the cinematography and of course the music , it 's great to hear "" gimme shelter "" again , but "" comfortably numb "" played in so well ."

fox has taken two of thei .,yeah . great set - design and action - terrible dialogue .
"so , i did not have big expectations on a movie exclusively focused in that character .","chris hemsworth brings a brilliant performance in that role , because he could perfectly combine the pompous and operatic "" classic "" thor with the dynamic and unstable modern thor ."
"loved it , the animation was outstanding .","indeed . rango is a great , fantastic , wrongly underappreciated film ."
"the cinematography is great , being very nasty in the property of leatherface .","even in the beginning it was tense when kemper is driving his van , when they see a disturbed young woman dangerously wandering on the road ."
clever and well acted throughout .,"so true , brosnan helps resurrect bond in an "" a "" effort ."
pierce brosnan portrays bond amazingly well in my opinion .,"without a cold war to fuel plot lines , the story is able to step into new territories , with many great plot elements ."
original and refreshing yet somewhat bittersweet,good gore aside i did n't think this was anything special . the sequel imo is much better and is everything this movie should 've been .
the film is a must - see and is the first masterpiece that 2013 has to offer .,"he does . linklater bares his soul , frame after frame , showing confidence of his own idiosyncratic vision of this story and being as accessible to even the youngest of people ."
ms. carmody says that the doorway was hell and that now we are paying for the soldiers ' mistakes .,"yes , now i remember , that 's where mrs. carmody says that the entrance was a hell and that we are now paying for the mistakes of the soldiers ."
the entire cast has hilarious one - liners and the two main characters really make this movie a joy to watch,"no , i actually mean this movie has a heart that i did not expect to see , it 's burried under lewd , vulgar and brilliant wit , but it 's in there ."
richie searches a u. s. plane but finds no drugs .,"he was good , i liked when he teams up with trupo who is mad at frank for blowing up his car ."
tedious boring and meaningless,i found them to be broken to a comical degree on almost every filmmaking level .
"when donnie stays at rocky 's place as they train bright and early , while also developing a close bond .","it was so nice how apollo chooses to continue seeking rocky 's help , while also deciding to pursue a relationship with bianca after hearing her perform at a night club ."
i liked the scene where he s trapped behind her bookshelf .,i liked the one in which cooper is behind the bookcase watching his daughter .
i think it was a fair sequel .,i think it was a fair sequel .
