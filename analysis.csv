"batman fight scene when saving martha , hands down best part of the movie .",i liked the one in which superman saves the jet before it crashes at the stadium

the theater was packed with little children who mostly laughed at not really funny parts .,"it kind of is , because it 's a story is about count dracule trying to raise his only child safe and sound away from terrifying humans and invites all the monsters to his hotel to relax and celebrate his very young daughter 's 118th birthday which is accompanied by a surprise visitor !"

the best spaghetti western ever ?,"it is one of my favorite westerns- a fitting middle section to the "" dollars "" trilogy ."
the story begins by introducing our two ( anti ),"from the opening scenes with cleef and eastwood , to the scenes in el paso , and then into the set pieces in the stone ruins in the mexico desert ( s ) , for a few dollars more displays the utmost skill by leone in his storytelling , as well as in his use of the camera ."
"good , the bad and the ugly","using fistful 's camera - man massimo dallamano , leone does what he does best in his spaghetti westerns- he creates a perfectly in sync mood with his characters ."
"in fact , that 's what makes his westerns such fun , is that you take them seriously as films .","as for the actors themselves , eastwood and cleef are total pros in this genre , so ever line of dialog comes out naturally , and the supporting actors ( however dubbed over from original italian ) all contribute great notes as well ."
my favorite character was catherine tramell because she was out of her mind and it was entertaining to see what she did next .,"i like the one in which tramell has dr. glass read a copy of her new novel which is based on recent events , including their sessions ."
"i like sharon stone a lot , but if the first film launched her career .",let 's state the obvious for starters - sharon stone is too old for the part of sexual magnet catherine trammell .
do n't watch this film for carnal thrills - there are none and what there is is tragic .,"i like sharon stone a lot , but if the first film launched her career , bi2 could kill it . she has no chemistry with stuffed - shirt david morrissey - their only sex scene is embarrassing too watch ."
"his dough - faced mamma 's boy of a character made me yearn for the swaggering , orange - skin machismo of michael douglas .","the film is , as a whole , convoluted to the point of utter confusion , boring and laughable . the last 40 minutes in particular , where you come to the realisation that the film is , in fact , not going to go anywhere of interest at all , are particularly gruelling and hilarious in equal measure ."
"it is now fashionable to trash "" basic instinct 2 "" even before you see it .",it is worse than any of us could have imagined ...
i think it was creepy and clever .,i think it was a great horror movie .
"the tension is raw , avoiding cheap jump scares and relies on music .","it was inspired by 70 's and 80 's horror , it follows is a refreshing psychological horror film with a simple premise and a chilling concept ."

look basketball shot ... that 's it .,"the movie is gore . alien = suspense , aliens = action , alien = tragedy , alien resurrection = gore"
"it has a very artistic and dynamic visual style , but cardboard characters .","it has a very overt sense of humor , but it is all done in a very juvenile manner . much of the maturity and restraint of the previous three films is thrown out in favor of a more comic book style ."
"the characters are basically action movie clichs , and the action sequences of the movie are hopelessly contrived .",oh yes the cinematography and set design is gorgeous to the point of decadence .
winona ryder absolutely kills this movie with her nonperformance .,the film is a brilliant exercise in dynamic visuals but the story really does not go anywhere . unlike the first three films this one does not take itself seriously at all so the danger level becomes nonexistent .

"rocky gets dropped a good 10 times that fight but keeps getting up , yet when he drops drago once , the show is over .","but number 5 breaks away from the 80 's crap brought to us by the previous 2 sequels . it goes back to its roots of a real story , and they brought the original director back for it ."

"mad max 2 "" is essential .","not to be compared to "" mad max 2 "" . i love "" the road warrior "" as well as the rest of the "" mad max "" series . i would say that "" mad max 2 "" is quite possibly the greatest film to come out of australia . it is one of mel gibson 's best and one of the best sci - fi films ever .

my favorite character was mako .,my favorite character is raleigh as he is the main hero of the film .
"pacific rim goes berserk with a great sense of wonder , camp and old - school action","i think "" pacific rim "" looks great but lacks everything else a movie needs to be good ."
the aliens and robots blend very well with all their surroundings .,it escapes me how sequences of robots and aliens fighting each other could be so uninspiring that i literally dozed off at points .
""" absolutely nothing exciting happens for 45 minutes in the middle , at which time they will get uncontrollably antsy and beg you to leave .","there 's no way any child under the age of 12 will sit through "" pacific rim . "" absolutely nothing exciting happens for 45 minutes in the middle , at which time they will get uncontrollably antsy and beg you to leave ."
everything else a movie needs to be good .,i think the acting was even poor . pacific rim pays tribute to modern cinematic technology by proving to the world a blockbuster no longer requires decent actors and scripts
i think it was crazyy,i think it was crazyy .
frank is ordered to leave without jack .,not bad anyway . i love frank mostly and i think the character is smart . i liked when frank is ordered to leave without jack . he discovers an explosive attached to the car and succeeds in removing it prior to detonation .
the action is excellent and is even better if you are able to suspend your disbelief for an hour or so .,the movie is action packed and the action is excellent and is even better if you are able to suspend your disbelief for an hour or so .
"shakespeare it is n't , but it 's not for the plot that i watch the transporter movies .",a spoilt brat with an outrageous word rope . the only disappointments for me were wardrobe related - he had too much stubble and wore way too many clothest .

it was as i expected .purely ridiculously awesome .,it was as i expected . purely ridiculously awesome .
"so , it 's with some surprise that fast five is arguably the best film in the series .","yes , the film does a good job of not wasting any time and most of the serious moments are kept to a minimum in favor of heist scenes or action . and in the action department , the film delivers tenfold ."
the climactic scene alone is worth the price of admission .,"not much of a suspense but the actions were far bigger , louder , and more exciting than any f&f film before it , action junkies should find themselves thrilled by the impressive set pieces and testosterone - laced mix of car and foot action ."
the climactic scene alone is worth the price of admission .,"he was not my best . vin diesel still ca n't play up emotion very well , making his attempts at the more serious scenes here a bit laughable . paul walker does n't fair much better and , unfortunately , even as a main character takes a back seat to vin diesel and dwayne johnson ."
i think it was a great comedy .,i think it was very funny . channing tatum and jonah hill made an odd but fitting duo .
"yes , morton jenko ( channing tatum ) are former classmates who meet again at police academy .",it was interesting when they end up becoming friends at the academy as they help with each others ' weaknesses with schmidt helping jenko study and jenko motivating schmidt through physical activity .
best comedy film i 've seen at the cinema in 2012 .,"the chemistry between jonah hill and channing tatum is brilliant , and it 's nice to see tatum in something other than his standard rom - com or "" rom "" setting ."
best comedy film i 've seen at the cinema in 2012 .,"i must admit i expected this to be at the same standard as maybe the change - up or the hangover part ii which were n't terrible movies , but they were n't the funniest movies i have seen either . this movie is more on par with the hangover ( the first installment ) , superbad and anchorman ."

the film never relied on violence to pull it along or keep the audience 's attention .,"i think that the movie rushes along at a feverish pace , and particularly gibson 's and glover 's success working together on screen make this a timeless action film that is not to be missed ."

"henry arrives , checks the mail to find a worm in a stylish black box .","it is disturbing , like when he gets out of bed to check its temperature and after the temperature reads fine he looks back at the baby seeing that it is covered in sores and apparently sick ."
i 've watched this city turn from pastures to the hell - hole it is now .,"i agree , and although henry seems to be devoid of any spark of personality , we ca n't help but sympathise with him throughout the film ."
"and it is this dismal reality i am faced with , only partially aware that there is anything better .","he is depressed , and the setting and scenery makes the film one of the most desperately depressing i have ever seen ."
the reason that i got into films in the first place !,"i disagree , i think it 's cinematic genius , but definitely not a date movie ."
i liked the one in my top 5 favorite movies !,i liked the one in which the blind female main character waited on the male main character to save her .
as the elders will not live forever .,"i did too , but it upset me that even though they are wearing yellow colored clothing ( considered a ' good ' color ) , and even though ivy claims she has a bag of magic rocks to protect them , christop turns back ."
"night shyamalan definitely did himself a disservice in releasing "" the sixth sense "" .","every since the sixth sense all people want is a twist because the "" twist "" ending was so powerful that audiences the world over expected nothing less from the talented young director ."
"the village "" is about these people , this community living in fear , not the monsters of which they have been satisfied .","i agree , that 's what happened to this movie because the adverts made it seem like a thrill - ride of gothic horror , like the scariest film yet to be filmed - and audiences were running in their droves to catch yet another shyamalan twist ."
it is the film i think people will watch 20 years from now and make a cult hit .,"nope , and it was very unfortunately advertised completely incorrectly ."

donnie takes many hits and spits out a lot of blood .,"and it works , because donnie strikes back and hits conlan multiple times before bringing him to the floor , but conlan gets up before the referee gets to 10 ."
"it 's a stark contrast to stallone 's blue collar stiff in the first film , but this is where both films converge .","yeah that sucked , but as a no- holds - barred sports drama , this is every bit an exceptional crowd pleaser with a lot of heart , plenty of amusing jabs to the ribs , and an unexpected but emotional haymaker to the gut ."
it did everything a movie is supposed to do .,"i cried , i laughed , i sat in suspense , i cheered . it did everything a movie is supposed to do ."
i liked the one in which he destroys the plan by lighting the jet fuel with a lighter .,i liked the one in which john mcclane fights the bad guys on the wing of the plane and then blows it up .

"the predator puts up a good fight cutting off its tail , surviving its acid blood and trapping it in a self tightening net causing it serious injuries , but it manages to kill the predator with its inner mouth .","i liked those too , like when he predator spares him and attempts to chase after lex and sebastian , weyland uses his inhaler and a flare to try and set it on fire , unfazed and enraged the predator kills him with his wrist blades ."
i completely understand why this movie got such terrible reviews ; after all .,"i agree , and i have to admit i enjoyed the movie from start to finish - because of the amazing set- and creature - design and the more than decent action sequences and special effects ."
"when i watched it yesterday i got angry at times because some of the dialogue - well , most of it , actually - is truly awful .","so true , whoever designed those really scored and seems to have a great love for the art of giger and the previous films ."

the action is excellent and is even better if you are able to suspend your disbelief for an hour or so .,"i 'll admit , there are a number of scenes that are so outrageous that you need to decide if you 're going to buy in or get out ."
it 's so bad that it 's good .,"that 's true , it 's a good friday night popcorn flick ."

easily one of the most powerful films i have ever seen .,"that 's because the story of how boxer jake lamotta watched his career and marriage crumble under the weight of his violent temper and deep - rooted misogyny is told with no punches pulled ( excuse the bad pun ) , as deniro ( in what may be his best performance ) and scorsese unflinchingly explore what drove this man over the edge , and what ultimately may have pulled him back"

"police academy "" is probably the ultimate manifestation of the word "" witless "" .","the sure are , and the plot basically has a series of goof - off misfits enrolling in the police force and turning it topsy - turvy ."

"cindy manages to track him back to the logan farm , where he has taken refuge with george .",the cindy character is an intelligent character she was the one who finds a link between the tape and the crop circles and then she cindy tries to warn everyone by entering a message into the news anchor 's teleprompter .
i totally loved this one .,tho the ending kinda weird but overall its gives me a creep .
bmi film & tv awards 2004 best cameo,"i do not think so . the opening scenes should be it , there were amazing and should have earned the movie the mtv movie + tv awards 2004 best cameo ."
i think it was a classic example of an 80s action film done well,commando is an 80s action movie where one man defets a whole army while making bad jokes .
a car from a dealership and crushes the dealer .,"one of my best scenes was when matrix blasts the gunman , and despite finding his truck sabotaged , he goes after the gunmen by driving the powerless truck down the steep mountain , intercepting one of the fleeing vehicles and attacking four armed thugs , beating two senseless before being beaten down himself ."
this is by far one of the greatest movies of the century .,"that was crazy of arnold . i can not just believe that when schwarzeneggar 's beloved daughter is kidnapped by a psychotic dictator , he does n't try to reason with the bad guys or take precautions like most action heroes would . he just goes bonkers and starts killing everyone in sight ."

this movie was touched by god !,for me total recall can not be compared to this movie in terms of perfection . the closest to it is red heat .
the original is still the best one .,i liked the one in which luc covers s. e. t. h. in liquid nitrogen .
the ultimate fight in cinemas 28 jan reanimated .,it was but it can not be compared to universal soldier : day of reckoning .

"these scenes make even more tragic the production 's unsettling conclusion and increase the overall dramatic impact , which is tremendous .","i think the movie is best when allowing nick nolte and james coburn to come to terms with each other 's hatred for each other . the performances are what make this movie much more distinct than similar but lesser films like "" the other sister "" and "" the story of us , "" and even better acted than the masterpiece award winner "" american beauty .

jake then asks if joey had an affair with his wife .,"vickie seems to be an impatient character . i remember when joey has a word with vickie , who says she is giving up on his brother ."
easily one of the most powerful films i have ever seen .,vickie should bear part of the blame even though i agree lamotta is just careless to have watched his career and marriage crumble under the weight of his violent temper and deep - rooted misogyny .

the fatal mistake .,i suppose so . winona ryder has a couple great scenes .

"i found eclipse to be the best , even though it is quite mediocre .","twilight was too dull , with boring actors , new moon was just a repeat of that , except with wolves , and breaking dawn part 1 was two hours of three things : 1 . bella and edward getting married , 2 . bella and edward having very unessential foreplay that results in a pregnancy , and 3 . bella sitting on a couch moaning and groaning with said pregnancy ."
"unfortunately , i have seen all of the movies , with some different opinions .i found eclipse to be the best , even though it is quite mediocre .",i will say i did not have many great expectations for this final installment .

"the humor is probably better than anything in the theaters this year , and the action is even greater .","it was the characters i cared about ( and note that the digitally created ship itself is one of them , and i cared just as much for that than any of them ) ."
this movie on a whim i college and love it .,joss whedon works his magic and succeeds wonderfully !
i liked the one in which the enemy ship hunts down the enterprise ship .,i liked the one in which the enemy ship hunts down the enterprise and does battle with both the enterprise and a romulan ship .
"the undiscovered country "" ( peace with our moral enemies !","same here , i have trouble deciding if this movie is good enough to justify continuing the franchise ; i 've got nostalgic feelings for the next gen crew , even though i prefer the originals , and maybe those feelings are acting in the same capacity as beer goggles ."
' ve got nostalgic feelings for the next gen crew,"i think the battle is fun . some of the "" deep "" questions raised about identity , cloning , and nature vs. nurture got me thinking ( although , in the end , they were largely irrelevant - the whole thing devolves into a fight ! ) ."
the battle is fun .,it is stilted dialogue . techno - babble . boring sets ( particularly for the enterprise ) . trying to pass off california filmed through a filter as an alien planet .
i like it better than insurrection .,"tom hardy almost killed himself because of how bad this movie is so for that reason i would say that yes , the hate is justified ."
i think it was great action thriller with lots of suspense .,i think this movie was one of the best action and science fiction moves to ever be made . this was a one of a kind masterpiece and is well loved .

i ca n't imagine peckinpah 's ' the wild bunch ' for example existing without leone .,"most people seem go for ' the good , the bad and the ugly ' as the best of the three movies , but i think ' for a few dollars more ' just beats it ."
"the gang arrive in the small border town of agua caliente , where monco is surprised to find mortimer waiting for him .",but mortimer proves his own worth and does exactly the same thing to manco .
i ca n't imagine peckinpah 's ' the wild bunch ' for example existing without leone .,"yeah . ' for a few dollars more ' is helped enormously by lee van cleef playing colonel mortimer , and the scenes between him and eastwood , and the ones between him and klaus kinski are pure gold ."

"you 'll "" die hard "" with this action - lover 's action movie",the ultimate thrill - ride and still the standard by which i judge an action movie
"also one of the best action films ever made , that happens to be a very good thing .",""" die hard "" is lean , mean , and does n't contain a single second of wasted screen time . the direction , the action , the story , the acting ... every aspect of this film comes close to big - budget action movie perfection ."
", john mctiernan puts on a perfect clinic as to how to pace an action movie .","a lot of recent action films just fly along at a mindless , breakneck pace , without ever allowing the story to breathe or the suspense to build ... unlike those films , "" die hard "" knows how to maximize the impact of each and every scene , and that 's why it stands out so clearly from them all ."
to deliver a deadpan one - liner better than anybody else in hollywood makes the character all the better .,"he always appears to have an ace hidden up his sleeve , and is so convincing at giving this impression , it 's hard to tell throughout the film whether he or mcclane truly have the upper hand ."

plus there is absolutely no chemistry between dan and albus severus .,"there 's no ... bonding with the characters , no connection with them you felt in part 1 ."
"see the movie , and i 'm sure you 'll form your own opinion of it .","it 's not a bad movie , just disappointing and unsatisfying for a die - hard fan who 's been following the books for 10 years of their life ."
everyone in to believing there was an emergency using his voice .,i like the one in which the character fools everyone in to believing there was an emergency using his voice .

"it is an excellent treatise of the human reaction when challenged with fear , danger and adventure .","i ca n't help but feel this movie doomed ned beatty 's acting career ( after seeing this film , every time you see ned beatty in any other role , you ca n't help but remember the infamous riverbank scene ) ."
a true classic .,this was definitely one of the most disturbing films of all time .
ed lowers the body down the cliff with a rope and climbs down after it .,it was pretty bad when ed and bobby weigh the dead hillbilly down with stones and drop him into the river and then set out with the injured lewis in the surviving canoe .

the film never relied on violence to pull it along or keep the audience 's attention .,"in this film you see the first of the now traditional lethal weapon scenes in which riggs and murtaugh stagger away from a smoking crime scene , seeming to hold each other up , very memorable ."
"the final fight scene between riggs and mr. joshua ( busey ) was a little excessive , and there were a few scenes which were a bit faulty .","well , i guess i would say that the movie rushes along at a feverish pace , and gibson 's and glover 's success working together on screen make this a timeless action film that is not to be missed . thank you ."

"the creature tells him he can find it in dirt , a day 's journey away .","it sure does , because the world goes awry when something in the road causes the car to jolt , and the chameleon and his aquarium fly out the back of the vehicle he 's in , shattering to the ground ."
in fact i would happily pay to see it again just to look at those shots again .,"it is fun , it 's entertaining , action - packed , funny and sincere ."

what we have here is a decent low budget vod or netflix watch .,"i agree , this was not going to be anywhere near the caliber of machete , that was funded in the millions & written very well ."
only positive thing about this movie is how good alexandra daddario looks .,i thought it was great ! idk it seems like people were expecting some sort of cinema masterpeice ? ? ? j

midnight is a different type of animal this time around .,i did n't expect the team could top an already beautiful story but what they achieve in the newest installment is the most accurate and authentic portrayals of love since michel gondry 's eternal sunshine of the spotless mind .
so so so good .,that alone makes before midnight is a masterpiece .

"closing the story arc of the alien trilogy , this film begins with a fresh slate .",the alien films have always been a director 's series but in this film it was the writing that ultimately killed it . resurrection tries to be too many things at once .
"it has a very overt sense of humor , but it is all done in a very juvenile manner .","it has a very artistic and dynamic visual style , but cardboard characters . it has a very overt sense of humor , but it is all done in a very juvenile manner . much of the maturity and restraint of the previous three films is thrown out in favor of a more comic book style ."
"the characters are basically action movie clichs , and the action sequences of the movie are hopelessly contrived .","very few scenes in the film are particularly memorable . sure , the underwater chase is a nice bit of action derring - do , but there 's no real sense of danger ... except for the supporting characters you barely know who get killed in the reverse order they appear in the credits ."

it may have been revolting,"these are great lessons but i think the best thing about "" hannibal "" is the atmosphere in which scott and his team envelop the story . a cloud of dread hangs over this film , and beautiful florence , italy , though still beautiful , appears haunted by lector 's very presence in the city ."

i honestly had always preferred the character of thor in small doses or as part of an ensemble .,"chris hemsworth brings a brilliant performance in that role , because he could perfectly combine the pompous and operatic "" classic "" thor with the dynamic and unstable modern thor ."
it would not be fair to only consider thor as an extra - large trailer of the avengers .,"that 's true , i think that the rest of the actors is also worthy of applause , starting by natalie portman , who can perfectly express her character 's emotions . i also liked the work from stellan skarsgrd ; his participation is relatively short and it would seem irrelevant if it was not for the dramatic weight this actor brings to the character with his mere presence ."

this is pretty unrelenting and wears you down .,the gore is strong and disgusting ( this got trimmed to get an r rating ) and i ca n't say i liked it ... but it did it 's job . it scared me . i was cringing in my seat a few times and jumped more than once .
"considering it 's basically a remake of the 2003 film , it works remarkably well .","that is a plus to the movie . all the acting is good . brewster , handley , baird and bomer are all good - looking and likable -- when the violence starts you really are horrified at seeing such great characters being tortured ."
"his character is so twisted , violent and sick that when he got a taste of his own medicine my quiet audience broke out in applause","wow , ermey is on hand giving another terrifying performance as hoyt . his character is so twisted , violent and sick that when he got a taste of his own medicine my quiet audience broke out in applause ."

i liked the one which thompson interviews kane 's estranged best friend .,i liked they one in which kane holds the snow globe and says rosebud .
citizen kane may let some people down,"citizen kane may let some people down , but it 's still worth seeing ."
a lot of things visually that no one had ever done before .,"this film was designed to be cinematically beautiful and to tell a basic story of love and redemption . there is much more to the story than the thinly veiled attack on hearst , one just needs to look deeper ."
this is not pure entertainment .,yes the title character was based on media giant william randolph hearst . he was that generations donald trump . he opposed this film so much he did everything in its power to stop its release and almost succeeded .
the story on the surface is outdated .,"look at shakespeare or hawthorne for example , their literary works are universally loved . yet , many people blow them off because they refuse to look past the outdated language into the beautiful prose and simple ubiquitous themes . just because something is outdated does not mean it lacks worth in today 's world ."
my favorite character was john mcclaine .,my favorie characters was john mcclane .
"i liked when mcclane attempts to alert the local police by setting off the fire alarm , but this fails , and he is promptly discovered by karl 's brother , tony .","i love all the actions especially when a convoy of trucks makes its way to the building . two men , karl ( alexander godunov ) and theo ( clarence gilyard jr. ) , arrive at the front desk to divert security 's attention away from the trucks ."
"basically revolutionized one of the most copied ( but never matched , at least in terms of quality .",clarence gilyard jr. was awesome too . but bruce remains my favorite even thought it seems bruce willis just did n't have the bulging biceps required for a role like this . but that 's the beauty of his performance in this movie .
"one could claim that 1988 's "" die hard "" was released , the action movies were most often dominated by the likes of arnold schwarzenegger , sylvester stallone , and chuck norris .","one could claim that 1988 's "" die hard "" is one of the most influential action movies ever made ."
the perfect modern action film,the story kept me spell bound . i actually prefer to call it the perfect modern action film .

the departed is sure to garner a host of oscar nods .,"the departed is tough stuff , not for the faint - of - heart ."
jim jarmusch is one of those few directors that can turn the ordinary into something extraordinary .,i liked the one in which hitler calls the doctors and nurse to the bunker to thanked them for their services .
werner haase are ordered to the bunker where haase gives hitler instructions on how to commit suicide .,"hilter was great , also liked when hilter then has his last meal with traudl and a few others , and then informs them that the time has come . he gathers around traudl and his remaining friends , including the goebbels , to wish them goodbye ."
der untergang makes you live the horrors and craziness of war .,"i agree , apart hitler the rest of the cast performs admirably . you feel transported to berlin as it was bombarded by the russians . you get a very clear insight ( or an impression ? ) in how the military decisions were taken during those final days of the war ."
it 's my favorite movie of 2016 .amazing realism .,"the movie is an impressive achievement , realistic and shocking ."
der untergang makes you live the horrors and craziness of war .,the movie is neither pro - nazi nor does it depict all nazis as mindless monsters . it gives an impression of utter realism .

"despicable me 3 , more like hang me from a tree .",all the characters were just amusing and i thought it was pretty funny when they came home drunk dressed as each other .
satan as the minions heh,its a strong fighting movie with predictable plot but still good .
this movie is a must watch for people who are into combat and self - defense .,i have n't seen the first two parts but this part was surely something ! no doubt the mma fighting skills of the characters were real time and no strings attached ; yes i mean no strings attached .
this movie is a must watch for people who are into combat and self - defense .,"the story may be considered on the lines of "" condemned "" , but with noteworthy differences and twists , i would say the director "" isaac florentine "" and his special effects team has done a marvelous job with the fight sequences , story line and characters in hand ."

yes it is a play on the classic western django .,"you know , i had eagerly awaited the arrival of rango , not only as a western fan but also as an admirer of gore verbinski ; and the inclusion of johnny depp has yet to be a bad thing ."
rango himself upon first meet is absolutely not a hero .,"yes . if you have seen the trailer you will have noticed the singing mariachi owls , who tunefully break down the forth wall to open the film ."
and finest detail is here !,"indeed . rango is a great , fantastic , wrongly underappreciated film ."
i like the one in which he wins the rap battle,i liked the one in which eminem wins the rap battle .

"i believe the fans , like me , of the original "" the texas chainsaw massacre "" will not be disappointed .","even in the beginning it was tense when kemper is driving his van , when they see a disturbed young woman dangerously wandering on the road ."
"the texas chainsaw massacre "" is a classic , and as i have already written in other reviews , i do not see any reason to release remakes of movies , mainly classics","they decide to help her , and the woman commits suicide inside the vehicle ."

the alien films have always been a director 's series but in this film it was the writing that ultimately killed it .,"really , sigourney weaver has been given an interesting character to play and does it with a strange sense of detachment that lends more depth to the proceedings than the script ever could ."
seeing a swimming xeno was pretty cool .,"winona ryder has a couple great scenes , namely meeting ripley 8 and the chapel scene ."
my favorite character was rocky balboa for his heart and love of the people in his life .,my favorite character was rocky because he seems the most like a leader and a father figure in this movie .

history has a strange way of repeating itself .,it 's interesting how history has a strange way of repeating itself .
a household name and turned an unwanted actor into one of the greatest success stories in hollywood .,"you know , for sylvester stallone , it was a rags to riches story that mirrored his real life struggles to make a decent and honest living ."
i loved how they introduced each opponent with his record and accomplishments .,but this film ... those final fight entrances felt like i was watching a ppv wwe fight . amazing .
i think it was the best bond film ever made .,"i think it was a great start for a new bond series . it had all of the bond elements gadgets , girls , chases and bond saving the world ."
bond is arrested and watches helplessly as xenia flies away .,"yes , bond is arrested and watches helplessly as xenia flies away ."
"pierce brosnan portrays bond amazingly well in my opinion , and ties all the classic 007 elements together flawlessly .","after a 6 year hiatus the producers needed to make this film good enough to bring bond back to the forefront , and in comparison to the films that followed , i believe this to be the best ."

lex and sebastian attempt to search the predator but are attacked by an alien chasing them to a collapsed bridge .,"with her , they deduce that this is why the current predators are here , to hunt the aliens again ."
is compared to the ridiculous dialogue .,"i completely understand why this movie got such terrible reviews ; after all , it marked the first "" let 's make a quick buck "" entry in the two beloved alien and predator franchises and was done by a director who many felt did n't treat the material with the respect it deserved ."
whoever designed those really scored and seems to have a great love for the art of giger and the previous films,but despite all those flaws i have to admit i enjoyed the movie from start to finish - because of the amazing set- and creature - design and the more than decent action sequences and special effects .
fox has taken two of thei,yeah . great set - design and action - terrible dialogue .
